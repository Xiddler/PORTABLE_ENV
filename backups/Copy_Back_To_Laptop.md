List of directories and files to copy back to laptop if it ever works again:

$HOME/all_org/org      :: all org stuff
$HOME/MY_ZIM/zim       :: all zim stuff
$HOME/Donaghs_Tmp      :: for everything else
$HOME/PORTABLE_ENV     :: but use GitHub repo for this

Run $HOME/BACKUPS/backup_to_RSYNC.sh
Also, run $HOME/.scripts/backup_all_and_encrypt.sh
to send latest to Dropbox. NOTE: Ensure Dropbox daemon is working.
