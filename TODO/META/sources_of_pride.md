### NOTES
I came up with this idea when I saw the names of the files in /TODO/META:
lies.md, preoccupations.md, excuses.md, fears.md
These are all very uninspiring and demotivating. I need to have a repositories of the positive aspects of my life experience which is something that is not encouraged in our culture in case it leads to sinful pride, hubris, bombast or complacency and such like.

But, I say, that each may can legitimately state the positives of his life experience judicially and fairly without being totally cowed by the negatives. 

So, before I make separate files for the various categories, here is a list of candidate areas that may be considered for positive review and assessment:

### SOURCES_OF_PRIDE.md
 my_skills.md
 interests.md
 hopes.md
 achievements.md
 good_points.md
 what_i_fixed.md

### My skills
This initial foray is quite vague
Engineering / construction / draughting / project management

Outdoor activities
Kayaking MTB bike repair hill walking navigation trip selection

Computer / IT
Linux, python, vim, full stack web-development, 

Indoor

### Hopes
This is a strange one for me. I don't really do hope. I do stoicism instead, put up and shut up. But here goes...

I hope that:
    As few people as possible will die from covid19
    The healthcare system will be able to cope with the load
    A treatment / cure will become available very soon
    That I will emerge from this crisis with vision for what to do with  the rest of my life <-- THIS! 

### Achievements

B.E. - engineering degree at 20 (pass degree)
