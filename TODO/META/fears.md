### Intro
To increase quality of life, grow your confidence. Ways to do this include Do what scares you.
This started because of what I wrote in README.md - that I don't do stuff fundamentally because I lack confidence. And one way to grow your confidence is to face your fears, something I have been doing regarding __some__ fears but definitely eschewing others, more significant fears. The fear of seeing myself in human society as a person (or something, can't find the right words).
Is all fear really based on ignorance? Mebbe.


### MY FEARS
2020-03-24 
1 Speaking in public
2 Chatting up women / girls (fear of being rejected )
3 Telephoning possible employers looking for a job
4 Kayaking unknown rivers alone (fear of dying horribly)
5 Rock-climbing (fear of dying horribly)
6 Heights (fear of dying horribly)
7 Trying to explain what I (want to) work at / do for a living (fear of losing the other person's respect / regard)
8 Being forced to look for work (shitty work) because I lack money ( fear of being degraded / deprecated )
9 Dealing with  "alpha" people - persons with  bit egos, massive confidence, authority, position <===== THIS!  ( therapist / psychologist? )
10 Talking __TO__ a group, talking __IN__ a group   (fear of losing the other person's respect / regard)
11 Being accused in the wrong without recourse to justice / fair hearing ( fear of being degraded / deprecated )
12 Living without getting to live - this is driving me to do this analysis in the first place ( fear of dying without ever being / feeling loved ) 
13 Being identified as an imposter person / human. False, insincere, a joke, incompetent, useless, a nothing....
14 Leaving my comfort zone <=== THIS!  
Well, the above fears were relatively easy to list. There is at least another one that needs mentioning that was mega for me for a large part of my life
15 The fear of being reminded of a __love lost__ - or was this more of a psychological agony than a fear. May need more work. <=== THIS! 

Wow, these are my fears. Not an infinite list. ( The list is not in any order ). And some of them are mere equivalents e.g. 1 and 10.

And to further distil them:
- fear of dying horribly and early
- fear of being rejected 
- fear of losing the other person's respect / regard
- fear of dying without ever being / feeling loved for who I am when considering only my faults
- fear of being degraded / deprecated (or is this equivalent to fear of rejection?)


### What used to scare the crap out of me but not so much now
- Heights - much more tolerant of them
- Rats - exposure to real-life and dead rats has lessened the primeval fear
- Being alone esp. after dark
- Deciding what to do with people I know who are repeatedly not nice to me
