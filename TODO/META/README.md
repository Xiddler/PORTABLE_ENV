### INTRODUCTION
This is another of my attempts to get the ball rolling in terms of actually doing something other than sitting for most of the day.

The terminal is a fine environment and is less distracting than the (very fine) zim desktop environment.

In my journal today I came up with the following:

---

I need a method of getting myself into the act of doing stuff. Getting sorted, started, motivated, rewarded....

One thing I need is a framework / structure in and around doing.
Four categories: 
    1. Things to do. 
    2. Significance: important, urgent, relevant, etc.
    3. When they are to be done. 
    4. Who benefits?.

1. A list of things to do:
    - Jobs
    - Chores
    - Tasks
    - Plans
    - Master plan

2. Significance:
    - Vital
    - Important
    - Urgent
    - Worthwhile
    - Relevant

3. Schedule:
    - One off
    - Occasional
    - Repeat: sometimes
    - Repeat: often
    
4. Who gains
    - Me
    - Someone else
    - Someone in particular
    - Lots of people
    - A specific group of people

### Structure
So, I have made a TODO folder in $HOME. I will move it to sd64 when I have some work done on it.


### Tools
Todo list
List of things that are important to do
Calcurse for scheduling and todos?
Alias for the above - quick and dirty --> cat $HOME/.calcurse/todo

### How my system works
The file TODO.ods is a formatted Calc / Excel file. This is Linux so I am using LibreOffice Calc instead of Excel.
It is formatted to be appealing visually. This is important so that I am interested in looking at the contents. For terminal access to the contents I have set up some shortcuts viz:
    lot - LibreOffice Tasks & Jobs
    lol - LibreOffice Lists
    vt  - view tasks :: These convert the .ods to .csv and the Unix column program pretty prints them to the Terminal
    vl  - view lists
(These are in zsh_aliases)

### Journal

### 2020-03-16
Well, I decided to make something in LibreOffice Calc. I found the todos in calcurse was not fine-grained enough to separate out different types of todos like tasks / jobs / projects / activities

I have a .csv file that I can open in LibreOffice Calc. The downside is that the .ods not the .csv is needed to retain the lovely UI UX.
Also the .csv is easily readable on the terminal with ->% column -s, -t < TODO.csv 

So, how to I do nice UX in .ods and export automatically to .csv?

### 2020-03-24
I was looking at my Projects sheet (shortcut vp - view projects). I like well enough the UX now - spreadsheet with black background and some colour as well as hiding the gridlines and headers. I think it is fit enough to do me well enough. But the conceptions and development of things I want to do is not so well developed. Which is a great problem of mine.
I notice that I can come up with vague Projects like - one night wild camping. Sure, that is a target but it is needs to be developed into a SMART target.
E.g. next Friday evening, spend the night camping on the Galtees. That's Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely.
Reward: The feeling of having had a new experience and organinsing it to a successful conclusion.

I kinda realise that the approach here is very unintuitive, lacking sponataneity and clunky.

What I really need to find is that thing that makes me tic, inspires me, brings me alive, motivates me, incentivises me, makes my heart sing. The only thing that could do this is __LOVE__. I need love, love...
Love for / of someone / something?
So how can I engender, bring about a feeling of love? 
Love life. And all its contents (including the present writer?)

Is there any benefit it giving consideration to the things that are obstruting love in my life? I seem to have done a lot of that over the course of my life without coming to any real conclusions of merit.
For example:
I can't love because:
    I have a dysfunctional personality
    Of my social phobia
    Of my timidity and lack of assertiveness 
    Of my poor communication skill
    Of my weird take on society / work / life
    Of my oddness
    Of my ...etc. etc.

The feeling of love (not to be confused with  infatuation / spike in optimism) is a worthy goal, no?

I opened fears.md and it was actually helpful to list out my fears. Fear of appearing incompetent / stupid / immature / in public or to authority figures was the big one. Then I remembered the biggest psychological trauma of my life - the period after losing the love in London. And the subsequent fear of being reminded of that lost love. But this was more psychological agony than raw fear. No perceived *danger* was about only the traumatic pang of a lost love / future life. And this was essentially brought about by ( I think ) my poor sense of self, poor ability to present myself, personality disorder (possible due to mental health issues, exacerbated by alcohol, no doubt), my lack of confidence, inability to properly relate to those whom I was meeting and living with, my selfish obsession / fear of losing access to sexual gratification, jealousy, etc. Jeez, I still haven't gotten to the bottom of this darkness. 

Now, this stuff is very painful and I am not sure how it helps me grow my confidence. I guess if I manage to process it by articulating it as best I can should help.

The issues I mentioned herein like abuse of alcohol and mental health issues are salient too.

So, there are these horrible demons inside me (us?). Bad memories, sad memories, conflicting values, painful experiences.... 

These matters can't be forever ignored and must be processed at least to a level where growth can again occur.

I don't present well to others. I don't know how to present myself. I don't know who I am.

I notice the contents of the META folder at this stage is all negative stuff. These things may be true (are true) but tend to demotivate somehow.
    excuses.md
    fears.md
    lies.md
    preoccupations.md
        README.md
Maybes?
    forbidden_fruit.md # fantasies / wrong'uns (but great excitement) ignoble desires.md

One thing I need to do is ramp up the positive. So I am looking for names of files that could help to motivate and incentivise and lead to positive productive action.
The danger is that it might lead to hubris or complacency. 
Anyhow, here are some candidates:

### Positives
sources_of_pride.md, my_skills.md, hopes.md, what_i_fixed.md, achievements.md, good_points.md,

Added /TODO/CSV to keep the .csv files separate and the TODO/ folder clean - yesterday 2020-03-24.
