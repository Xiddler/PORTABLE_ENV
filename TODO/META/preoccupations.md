# List of things that are preoccupying me

I would like this list to be helpful to me to remind me that considering these things - for too long - may be of no benefit to me and in fact may be doing me harm.
These are occupying my mind to no end and are stopping me from doing things that would be funner, more rewarding, better, more valuable.
Even this tendency of mine to theorise on everything is a problem.


### Questions
Why am I not interested in looking for work? 
Why am I not motivated to participate in society / economy?


Social anxiety
Lack of self-possession, self-efficacy, self-respect, proper pride...
*** Dreadful terror at standing up and speaking in public, to authority, to a group, etc. ***
Comment: They have not gone away
