## Notes on excuses
Types: All bad really....
A major issue with me is my lack of self-confidence / confidence / portraying confidence. It varies a lot. Sometimes I appear very confident and at other times I am unfathomably below meekness.

### The sources of my deep lack of confidence - possibilities:
- Not feeling the love as a child
- Not growing up getting affirmation
- Abnormal / defective genetalia - partly due, perhaps, to childhood accident?
- Physical attributes of an attractive male are lacking
- Awkward / dysfunctional personality
- ~~Years~~ Decades of isolation and absence from social involvement
- Odd / distorted views / take on life, society, economy, people, humanity, social norms, normal behaviour...

I am saying here that my analysis reveals that I am hugely lacking in confidence. So this is the matter to address.


## UNDEFINITIVE LIST OF EXCUSES:


### Jobs and tasks around the house
Excuses for not doing stuff around the house...
Would disrupt / upset my co-habititant.
Would require heavy input, physically, from me.

### Regarding getting my life working again
This task is too big, messy and complex....
Is it?

### Regarding seeking work - Mar 2020
I would only take a job if I really  needed the money. I don't __really__ need the money. (But I probably do....)
