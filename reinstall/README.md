This is a helper file when dealing with a full reinstall like I did in Dec 2021.

I had a timeshift snapshot but for some reason the kernel and the boot process did not see eye-to-eye.

The file /run/media/donagh/01d4c077-4709-4b5b-9431-087bc9060d68/full_manjaro_reinstall_Dec2021.md has notes I took while reinstalling
manjaro over the course of almost 2 days.

I used the following command to store this file PORTABLE_ENV
rsync -a ~/SD64/full_manjaro_reinstall_Dec2021.md .         NOTE: that . is the current folder!
NOTE: maybe add this file to .gitignore. GOOD IDEA.



The only glitch I could not easily fix was caffeine-ng.
