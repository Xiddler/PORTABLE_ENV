" Install
" curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

" This file is where I call the plugins I want to use in vim. There is a line in .vimrc that calls this file
" I am using the vim-plug plugin manager from https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug 
" .vimrc --> ~/.vim/plugins
" vim starts -->  ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim 

" === Enable / Disable Plugins ===
" 2022-02-13 Created this new - external - sub-vimrc file 
" 2022-02-05  vim-plug started 
" https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug and https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/tutorial
" Remember to :so % after adding a new Plug or just PlugInstall in any vim file

" ALTERNATIVE:
" There is the alternative of using the built-in vim package manager (see " ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim)
" Ref: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-manage-vim-plugins-natively
" 
" Create the folder ~/.vim/pack if it doesn't exist
" On opening, Vim looks for a _start_ and an _opt_ subdirectory somewher in " ~/.vim/pack
" Plugins found under the _start_ are loaded automatically; those inside the _opt_ directory, instead, must be loaded manually.
" A suitable structure for this folder might be:

" /home/donagh/.vim/pack/
" ├── colorschemes
" │   ├── opt
" │   └── start
" ├── others
" │   ├── opt
" │   └── start --▷ nerdtree
" └── syntax
"     ├── opt
"     └── start

" EXAMPLE: To load package "nerdtree" do this: 
" git -C ~/.vim/pack/others/start clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree
" The -C option allows git to move into the specified directory before executing the “clone” command
