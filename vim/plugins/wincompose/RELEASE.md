Release Howto for WinCompose
============================

① Ensure the version information is up to date
----------------------------------------------

Edit `README.md` preemptively to link to the new version.

Make sure to run `./update-data.sh` so that translations are up to date.

② Commit, tag and push
----------------------

③ Build installer and portable versions
---------------------------------------

Just run `make` in an MSYS2 shell. Building the Visual Studio solution
will not be enough, as it only builds the installer.

④ Upload packages
-----------------

Create a [new release](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose/releases)
on GitHub and upload the `.exe` and `.zip` files.

⑤ Update website for the automatic updater
------------------------------------------

The queried URL is http://wincompose.info/status.txt

⑥ Advertise release on news websites
------------------------------------
