-> % zoxide init zsh

usage
->% zoxide add ~/REPOS/books        :: then you can cd to books using ->% z boo
->% zoxide query -ls
->% zi boo                          :: interactively search the database

->% z <target-dir>

Also, if `z` is not functioning:
->% `__z_oxide ` <target_dir>

should work as it comes with zoxide
