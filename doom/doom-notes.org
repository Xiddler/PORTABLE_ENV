** multiple org files
   Suppose you have many files that you want org-mode to 'watch'. In the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers of .spacemacs:
   Say, work, school and home.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-agenda-files (list "/home/donagh/org/work.org"

** copy / paste
*** How do you copy to the system clipboard?
use register: "+
Highlight word(s) using (vim) v and y
To copy full line to system clipboard: "+Y (like yy)
*** How do you paste from the system clipboard?
TL;DR - use the middle button of the mouse.

Paste into current file
[SPC] i r
[SPC] i y <-- displays system clipboard (killring) 2020-05-17_20:36 -- at last
Update: 2021-04-16: this did not work for me now. The [SPC] i r works!
[SPC] i r <-- evil register <-- equivalent to :reg in vim

Update: 2021-05-27 NOT WORKING. I copy a URL into the system clipboard but cannot paste into doom-emacs. WTF?
SOLUTION: Use the middle button of the mouse! This definitely worked. But why no keybinding?
Possible alternative:
On Linux, you can use xclip.el (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/xclip.el) to link the kill-ring to the clipboard from Emacs running in terminal (without losing the multiple-kill and yank capability).


** configuration
.doom.d directory is the preferred place to store your custom config (not within the Doom directory itself).
See the documentation (Henrik is super great about this)
My config files __are__ indeed in /home/donagh/.doom.d and symlinked to /home/donagh/PORTABLE_ENV/doom/*.el

this allows to explore inside the current project
*** files outside current project [SPC] .  <-- <space> dot
this allows to explore outside the current project
** elisp
*** REPL
M-x ielm or [SPC] o r
*** see [[snippets]] below for begin_src
** files
- save file -> :w OR [SPC] f s
- save buffer -> [SPC] b s OR :w
- open a file -> [SPC] f f and select your file for opening
- open a recent file -> [SPC] f r

** installation notes
*** install
from https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs
*** config files
"doom install will deploy three files to your DOOMDIR (/home/donagh/.doom.d)
_init.el_
    Where you’ll find your doom! block, which controls what Doom modules are enabled and in what order they will be loaded.
    This file is evaluated early in the startup process, before any other module has loaded.
_config.el_
    Where 99.99% of your private configuration should go. Anything put here will run after all other modules have loaded.
_packages.el_
    Where you declare what packages to install and where from.
   
*** configuration
/home/donagh/.doom.d/*
These files are symbolic linked to /home/donagh/PORTABLE_ENV/doom/* - to keep my config if reinstalling
/home/donagh/.emacs/doom-emacs/init.el

*** projectile
**** About
 Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing external dependencies

cf. also projectile for treemacs
**** Background
REM: Projectils confines the scope of files available to those in the project you selected with [SPC] p p
-----
If you are more familiar with IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ, you probably already have a concept of a project in your mind. It’s basically a folder for a particular codebase (probably under version control) that is pretty much a cohesive unit that you work on independently. In Emacs, this grouping and identification is usually managed by Projectile. With Doom, this is installed by default.

from https://medium.com/urbint-engineering/emacs-doom-for-newbies-1f8038604e3b
'
In order to manage projects that you already have, you need to let Projectile know where the projects reside.
Inside of Doom, you do this by modifying the init.el inside your own custom configuration folder:

    /home/donagh/.emacs.d/modules/private/<your-user-name>/init.el

For example, my username is “jdemaris” so my folder is /home/donagh/.emacs.d/modules/private/jdemaris is my custom folder. Keeping all of your changes in here makes it safer to update the Doom config whenever new versions come out. Inside of my init.el file, I have added a number of Projectile projects:

    (projectile-add-known-project "/home/donagh/Projects/playground/elixir")
    (projectile-add-known-project "/home/donagh/Projects/playground/otp")
'

** tags :tags:

To make a tag (only on headlines) add a colon before and after a word like this :tags: Now 'tags' is a tag.

To search for a tag C-c \ OR C-c / m

" An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating information is to assign tags to headlines. "
tags are words preceded by : and ending in : e.g. :donaghs: or :work: - these can then be searched using  C-c \ OR C-c / m

C-c }           :: toggle coordinates in the table
calc-eval       :: to evaluate an expression using calc (seems to be missing in doom-emacs?)

** issues with org
*** Can't list agenda or TODOS after replacing directory
Today - 2020-10-03 - I changed org directory from ~/ALL_ORG/org to ~/all_org/org

Now I can't list agenda or todo using [SPC] a a / [SPC] a t
I did change the files config.el and init.el but to not great avail
Solution: restart doom and/or doom sync
