I know I need to improve my communication skills. I am _very_ poor at communication and understanding communication, particularly speaking to other people.

"But crucially, the person to whom I am speaking can only understand what I am trying to say if they do the converse: if they see past my individual words and have a sudden intuition of the more unified, coherent idea that I had in mind and was trying to communicateâ€”an idea which was itself carved out of my holistic, gestalt experience of the entire situation."

I think this is one of my failings when I try to communicate. I am not properly aware of the gestalt picture that other people _may_ and _do_ have in their heads and I try to communicate only using words isolated from the gestalt picture, usually because I don't have the "holistic, gestalt experience of the entire situation" (HGEES for short) in my own head anyway.

My difficulties have been that my arrested cognitive development has not afforded me the ability to construct these HGEES in many cases, which leads to the situation where I don' really know "what's going on". In order to be plausible, credible and an effective speaker / communicator one _must_ know "what's going on" and one must be able to assure and impress on 'the other' that one does, enabling good inter-communications.

To ask the question: "Do I really know what's going on?". "Am I fully 'with it'?" How do I impart that to the other person? Do I know that I need to?

Sometimes: Do I know that I don't know what's going on? Can happen that I don't. It did happen because I was UNABLE to concretise the reality.
How does it happen that I don't know what's going on? How can it be that I am not "with it"?
How do I get to be "with it"? With what? What is "it"? The HGEES, I guess.
