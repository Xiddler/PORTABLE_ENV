;;; package --- Summary
;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
;;; Code:
(setq user-full-name "Donagh McCarthy"
      user-mail-address "xiddler@gmail.com")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 20))
;;; Code:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Source Code Pro" :size 20))
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Liberation Mono" :size 20))

;; disable org-roam warning ref version2 - added 2021-10-11
;; (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)


;; use avy search in all windows
;;; Code:
(setq avy-all-windows t)
;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)
;;; Code:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-solarized-dark)
(setq doom-theme 'tsdh-dark )


;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/all_org/org")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
;; (setq display-line-numbers-type t)
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; use for SLIME lisp
(setq inferior-lisp-program "sbcl")
;; Emacs by default syncs with the system clipboard when cutting or pasting text.
;; This can be really annoying if you do things like paste from the clipboard after a c w in normal mode,
;; because the clipboard will be overwritten before you can paste its contents. The following line should disable this behavior:
(setq select-enable-clipboard nil)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to this file.
;;      Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; Donaghs - the following keybinding *did* work. :n indicates normal mode
(map! :n "Q" 'org-babel-execute-src-block ) ;; Quantify! or Execute snippet!
(map! :n "SPC d" 'treemacs ) ;; Tree directory for files / folders
(map! :n "tt" 'org-todo )
(map! :n "ts" 'org-schedule )
(map! :n "SPC a" 'org-agenda )
(map! :n "SPC w SPC" 'ido-kill-buffer )
(map! :n "SPC s SPC" 'save-buffer ) ;; even simpler than w
(map! :n "SPC j" 'outline-next-visible-heading )
(map! :n "SPC k" 'outline-previous-visible-heading )
(map! :n "SPC l" 'org-insert-link )
(map! :n "SPC z" '+org/close-all-folds ) ;; z M is such a pain
(map! :n "SPC c SPC" 'calendar) ;; quick calendar
;; (map! :n "SPC v" 'org-agenda) ;; view org-agenda next 14 days

;; change the symbol on collapsed headings
;; (setq org-ellipsis " â–¼ ")

;; (after! org
;;   (setq org-hide-leading-stars t
;;         org-startup-indented t))
