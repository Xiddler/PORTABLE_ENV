Not maintained anymore. I use zoxide now.

dirjump
Easily jump to recently used directories with oh-my-zsh's 'd'-like directory history that still saved after exiting the terminal.

# Installation

    Download the script.

     curl --create-dirs -o ~/.config/dirjump/dirjump https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imambungo/dirjump/master/dirjump

    Source the script to your shell. Don't forget to restart your terminal afterward.

     echo 'source ~/.config/dirjump/dirjump' >> ~/.bashrc

    If you use Zsh:

     echo 'source ~/.config/dirjump/dirjump' >> ~/.zshrc
