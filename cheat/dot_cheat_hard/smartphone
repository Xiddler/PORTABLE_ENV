### Notes

# This is a cheat for how to connect the laptop to my smartphone 
# Mainly for the purposes of copying items (photos and videos) from smartphone  to laptop
# in the easiest and most efficient way possible or suitable.

# NOTE: FOR ALL THE FOLLOWING METHODS THIS STEP IS NECESSARY
# First, copy the relevant photos into a distinct folder on the smartphone so that they can be found
# when searching for them on the laptop via the FTP server.
# Ideally, make a new folder with a unique identifier incl. date
# MOST IMPORTANT STEP
# Then copy the media into that folder. To copy, open the Files app and locate Camera folder. Select the media
# items I want to copy over then navigate to the Newly Created Folder (which I usually place on the SD Card in the
# Pictures folder and paste them in the Newly Created Folder there.

### WiFi Pro app on the smartphone 
# Start up the server and copy from smartphone to laptop or download. 
# On smartphone, start the app WiFi Pro FTP Server
# On the laptop browse to 
ftp://192.168.1.104:2221 # or the URL indicated by the app 
# Then click each file to download it. (Very tedious if there are a lot of files.)


### SSH 
# Requirements 
# the smartphone file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys contains the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa_temux.pub of the laptop
# 104 is the IP for the smartphone (or change to the correct one in the cli command below)
# sshd is running in Termux on the smartphone 
# On the laptop, check that a ssh connection is available to the smartphone 
->%  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_termux u0_a163@192.168.1.104 -p 8022
# Then exit ssh.

### SFTP Method
# Ensure that ssh is available as in the previous
# On the smartphone 
# cd to /mnt (by using cd .. multiple times and then using cd /mnt - this usually gets to /mnt. 
# Then navigate to ext_sdcard/Pictures or wherever you copied your photos to)
# On the laptop
$ sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_termux -P 8022 192.168.1.104

# This will open the sftp> prompt at the remote location that sshd was invoked on Termux (the smartphone )
# To copy a file from the smartphone (remote) use get as in
sftp> get image22.png
# This will copy the file image22.png to the folder where the sftp command was invoked on the laptop
#
# WhatsApp
# "Unlock to link a device"
Simply place finger on camera at back - it's a security feature!
