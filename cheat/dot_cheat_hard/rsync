# To copy files from remote to local, maintaining file properties and sym-links (-a), zipping for faster transfer (-z), verbose (-v).

# Copy files using checksum (-c) rather than time to detect if the file has changed. (Useful for validating backups).

# This command will create /dest/foo if it does not already exist

# Explicitly copy /src/foo to /dest/foo
rsync -auv /src/foo/ /dest/foo
