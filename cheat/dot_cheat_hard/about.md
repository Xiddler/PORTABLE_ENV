# INTRO

This is a cheat for things about computers that I want to keep
Mainly it is simple high-level concepts that are sometimes missed in the thicket of programming
Computer concepts in plain English

# What is a Virtual Machine
A VM is an isolated Operating System hosted on a base OS
eg You could run Ubuntu on Manjaro in a VM


# Hypervisor
A hypervisor is a piece of software that allows you to run VMs
Examples of Hypervisors are: VirtualBox, VMWare, QEMU, KVM 

# ISO
Is a disk image often used to create boot media to allow the installation of an OS on your system


# ORM - Object-Relational Mapping
Without an ORM, running a query would be in a different programming language (ie SQL) to the surrounding code
The abstraction provided by say Django's ORM lets you forget about all those details, allowing you to focus on the business logic.

# SPA single page applications (SPAs). 
A SPA is loaded only once and afterwards, everything is updated dynamically using Javascript. An example of a SPA application is Gmail.

# Serverless
serverless doesn’t mean that there’s no server. It only means that you’re utilizing someone else’s server.

# AWS Services

# Porcelain
User-friendly interface for an application e.g. Magit in Emacs is a git porcelain (probably the best)

# An expression (in contrast to a statement)
An expression is an unit of code that can be evaluated to produce a result.
