# BATCH RENAME
# Lowercase all files and folders in current directory
rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

# Replace 'sometext' with 'replacedby' in all files in current directory
rename 's/sometext/replacedby/' *

# using zmv
# e.g.  remove the (z-lib.org) from the filenames of the books in Computer_books [ to allow searching for
# org-mode files]
zmv '(*)\(z-lib.org\).pdf' '$1.pdf'

# USING RANGER (THE WAY!!)
# use the bulkrename function in ranger. It opens a buffer in vim
# see YouTube Luke Smith https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzD2UdQl5Gc
1. open the dir in ranger (shortcut ->% ra)
2. select files (all files? shortcut V)
3. :bulkrename (this opens a buffer with all the selected files)
4. make the changes (in vim escape the grouping parentheses e.g. \( and the capture is e.g. \1)
5. save changes e.g.  :wq
6. confirm everything before committing with :q<enter>

# END BATCH RENAME
