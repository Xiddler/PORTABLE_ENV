# intro

All you are actually doing is adding the contents of your id_rsa.pub file to your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your linux host. 
(You may need to run 'systemctl restart ssh'.)

# To copy a key to a remote host:
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@host
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_toshiba donagh@192.168.1.86


# To copy a key to a remote host on a non-standard port:
ssh-copy-id username@host -p 2222

# To copy a key to a remote host on a non-standard port with non-standard ssh key:
ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/otherkey "username@host -p 2222"
