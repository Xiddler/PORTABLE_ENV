# Instead of giving multiple people root permission on a Linux system, you can grant root access on a per-command basis with the sudo command.
#Using sudo provides the following security benefits:
* The root password does not have to be given out.
* You can fi ne-tune command access.
* All sudo use (who, what, when) is recorded in /var/log/secure.
#
# to include sudo password in a bash script
sudo -S <<< "1234" <command>
