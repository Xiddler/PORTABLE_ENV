The ebook formats:

AZW: Amazons proprietary format; similar to MOBI. With this format, DRM protected files cannot be viewed by other devices. If it's an unprotected file, such as personal documents converted to AZW, the file extension can be changed to .prc and .mobi to view with different devices.

BBEB: Sony's proprietary format; stands for Broadband eBook. There are three file type variants: .lrx for DRM protected; .lrf for non-encrypted; and .msd for dictionaries.

CHM: Stands for compressed HTML. Used for large reference manuals and help documentation. Windows uses CHM for help files.

DJVU: A format by Lizardtech; widely used for scientific publications. DJVU uses advanced compression techniques for high-resolution images of scanned documents, digital documents, and photographs. Its compression ratio is about 10x better than PDF, and retains the same high quality.

DOC: Not to be confused with PalmDOC, .doc is Microsoft word's format. Can be converted to other file types for improved ebook viewing.

EPUB: A popular open ebook standard defined by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB is based on XHTML and XML and is one of the more popular ebook formats. Adobe Digital Editions uses EPUB formatting.

FB2: Stands for Fiction Book version 2; based on XML. FB2's main focus is to preserve accurate ebook structure and to make it easy to convert to other popular ebook formats.

HTML: Stands for HyperText Markup Language; the language used by all internet websites that any browser can read.

LIT: The native format used for Microsoft Reader.

LRF: Sony's proprietary format. See BBEB.

PDF: Stands for Portable Document Format. The most widely used file type. Created by Adobe. Most ebook readers support PDF, but it's a challenge to display a 14ins diagonal page on a 6ins diagonal screen. There are conversion softwares, such as Calibre, that reformat PDF to display better on ebook readers.

PRC: Stands for Palm Resource Compiler; aka MOBI.

RTF: Stands for Rich Texture Format; one of the most widely interchangeable ebook formats and supported by most ebook readers and word processors. RTF retains special characters and text formatting.
