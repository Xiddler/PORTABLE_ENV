## Disable Caps Lock


Although Windows 11 doesnâ€™t provide any easy way to disable the Caps Lock key, there are third-party apps such as PowerToys and AutoHotKey that let you disable it.
Alternatively, you can alter a registry key to disable the Caps Lock key. Read the article below to know how to go about this. See
