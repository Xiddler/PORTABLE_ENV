## Sample - Euro symbol

€ symbol on Windows — how to?


### Method 1

Type out the letters of euro 	:: this is an AutoHotKey shortcut — works system wide on Windows for me; added 2024-11-14; 



### Method 2

Win + ; to open the Emoji Picker (which includes loads of symbols too!)

Select Symbols (right most icon on the tab line) →  Currency Symbols → pick €

Also has, for example:

✓

NOTE: Emoji Picker uses frecency so € is the first one and stays there

Also, consider "sticking" it in CopyQ ⇐ done!!

€



NOTE: Symbols has the following sub-folders

* General Punctuation		:: § ℉ © ® № ‖ ‰ ※ ✓ ✕ ⁀ ‿ ⁈  ⌂  

* Currency Symbols			:: € 

* Latin Symbols				:: æ

* Geometric Symbols			:: ↪   ↴

* Math Symbols				:: ⅞ ⅚ ⅟ ∃ Ⅷ ∅ ∑ ∏ ∬ ∳ ≈ ≳ ⋃ ⑽

* Supplemental Symbols		:: ⨚⨝⨴⨿⨺⩒⩨ 

* Language Symbols			:: Δ ζ ξ χ ψ Ω ἄ Έ Ἕ ᾕ ἴ Ὃ ᾧ ϴ Ͻ ϐ



### Method 3

Win + R and type in charmap to activate character map pop-up window

Select e.g. font "Arial"

Type in euro  in the search bar. Works!!

### Method 4

Open zim and type \euro to get € and copy/paste that into the application
