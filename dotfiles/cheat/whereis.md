# Upload files over LAN from one device to another
smartphone laptop tablet...

HINTS:
The browser way of uploading files over LAN. Sept 2023 - Oct 2023.
Found on github.
python/flask I think
virtualenvs?

It had only a few 100+ stars on github
It warned against using in develoment - LAN only
It was good, IMHO
It can upload/download files
I was impressed.

Ih feel I recorded it - zim-wiki  or cheat
