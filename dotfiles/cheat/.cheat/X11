The X Window System 

instead of the more (incorrect) shorthands 
"X", "X-windows", "X11", or "Xorg"


FYI: A precursor of the X Window System was the W Window System.

X consists of three parts:

1. The Server The part that knows about the hardware and how to draw lines and write characters.

2. The Clients Such things as terminal emulators, dvi previewers, and clocks

3. The Window Manager A programme which handles negotiations between the different clients as they fight for screen space, colours, and sunlight.

Another fundamental X-concept is that of resources, which is how X describes anything that a client might want to specify; 
common examples would be fonts, colours (both foreground and background), and position on the screen.
