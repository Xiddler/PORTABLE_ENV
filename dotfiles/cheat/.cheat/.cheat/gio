# gio
gio is a utility that makes many of the GIO features available from the commandline. In doing so, it provides commands that are similar to traditional
       utilities, but let you use GIO locations instead of local files: for example you can use something like smb://server/resource/file.txt as a location.

       Plain filenames which contain a colon will be interpreted as URIs with an unknown protocol. To avoid this, prefix them with a path such as ./, or with the
       file: protocol.

# list items in trash
gio list trash://


# move


# empty trash with: 
gio trash --empty
