# Web terms

## Static websites
Static websites are designed for building content-rich websites including most marketing sites, publishing sites, documentation sites, blogs, portfolios, and some ecommerce sites.

## Web applications

By contrast, most modern web frameworks are designed for building web applications. These frameworks work best for building more complex, application-like experiences in the browser: logged-in admin dashboards, inboxes, social networks, todo lists, and even native-like applications like Figma and Ping.
