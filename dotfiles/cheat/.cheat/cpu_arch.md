# ISA

An instruction set architecture (ISA) or architecture for short is a family of CPUs (processors) who support the same instructions. 

The two most prominent architectures in the desktop world are:
- the x86 architecture 
- the x86_64 architecture

But many other architectures exist, such as sparc, ppc (the PowerPC family), mips, arm, etc...
Also riscv architecture

# Table of Architectures

CPU Architecture            |       Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`64 bit architecture`

x86_64/x86/amd64            |       Same name for 64-bit AMD/Intel CPUs             ← AMD / Intel

AArch64/arm64/ARMv8/ARMv9   |       Same name for 64-bit ARM CPUs                   ← ARM / Aarch

rv64gc/rv64g                |       Same name for 64-bit RISC-V CPUs

ppc64le 64-bit              |       PowerPC CPUs with little-endian memory ordering

`32 bit architecture`

i386 32-bit                 |       AMD/Intel CPUs

AArch32/arm/ARMv1 to ARMv7  |       Same name for 32-bit ARM CPUs


# AMD64

AMD64 is a 64-bit architecture that is compatible with the x86 architecture (and thus also known as x86_64). 

It was first used by AMD (under the AMD64 name) and Intel (under the EM64T name) and is now the most prominent architecture for medium and high-end desktop PCs. It is also commonly found in the server segment. 

Variants include: 
AMD Athlon 64, Opteron, Sempron, Phenom, FX, Ryzen, Threadripper, and Epyc along with Intel Pentium 4, Core2, Core i3, i5, i7, i9, Xeon, and some Atoms.

# ARM32

ARM is a 32-bit architecture that is very popular in embedded and small systems. 

Sub-architectures range from ARMv2 to ARMv6 (legacy), to ARMv6-M (Cortex), as well as ARMv8-R and ARMv8-M and are often found in smart phones, tablets, hand-held consoles, end-user GPS navigation systems, etc. 

Variants include: 
StrongARM and Cortex-M.
