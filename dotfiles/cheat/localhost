## Mkdocs 

Rather than hosting your documentation on a server, you may instead distribute the files directly, which can then be viewed in a browser using the file:// scheme.

Note that, due to the security settings of all modern browsers, some things will not work the same and some features may not work at all. In fact, a few settings will need to be customized in very specific ways.

    The site_url must be set to an empty string, which instructs MkDocs to build your site so that it will work with the file:// scheme.

    site_url: ""

## How do you do this in general?

Firefox prevents this sort of thing for security reasons. Use a proper file server or else go home.
