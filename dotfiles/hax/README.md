haxe() { vim /home/donagh/PORTABLE_ENV/dotfiles/hax $1 }


# Notes

Like ~/.cheat files for quick and easy access to computer commands, hax is my idea for having quick and easy access to hacks
and tips and tricks for the non-computer domains.

Domains like
shoelaces
knots
fuses
books
vitamins

You get the picture
