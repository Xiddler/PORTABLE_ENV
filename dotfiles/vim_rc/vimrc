"{{{ Minimum Settings

" Base filepath: /home/donagh/PORTABLE_ENV/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc

" === Min settings === 
" cf. /usr/share/vim/vim82/defaults.vim 
" 'set nocompatible' is never necessary in a vimrc file. When Vim detects a user vimrc file, it automatically sets nocompatible. 
" set backspace=start,eol,indent  no longer needed

" Minimal .vimrc location 
" /home/donagh/PORTABLE_ENV/vim/vimrc_files/minimal_vimrc
" usage:
" vvim <afile> is an alias on Toshiba for this — no folding, no plugins, horrible!

"inoremap jk <esc>
set <esc>=jk 

" use spacebar to enter command mode. This matches doom-emacs for me and my muscle memory
nnoremap <space> :


" encoding
set encoding=utf-8
" set fileencoding=utf-8
"
" Better COPY & PASTE
" When you want to paste large blocks of code into vim, press F2 before you paste. 
" At the bottom you should see ``-- INSERT (paste) --``.
set pastetoggle=<F2>
set clipboard=unnamed

" Remember more commands and search history
set history=500
set undolevels=500

" Rendering — added 2024-04-25
set ttyfast

" Open new split panes to right and bottom, which feels more natural than Vim's default
set splitbelow
set splitright

" === GNU Stow === 

" As of 2022-03-19 I am using stow to manage the symlinking of my dotfiles.
" See $HOME/PORTABLE_ENV/dotfiles/README.md 
" Usage: On a new install -> %~ stow vim  will automatically create the necessary symlinks from this folder 


" ===  $MYVIMRC ===

let $RC="$HOME/.vimrc" " alternative to $MYVIMRC

" NOTE: See Leader section below. These are just reminders.

" nnoremap leader vv :tabe $MYVIMRC<CR> - this seems to invoke visual
