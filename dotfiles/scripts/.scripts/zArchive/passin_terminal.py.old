Update: This has been superseded.





Use the following command to run in RPi
-> % sudo python3 cli_passin.py

This script is a CLI version of the tkinter GUI passin python utility
that I wrote to provide a handy way of entering credentials and storing
them in my zim file 11SignUps.txt in .json format.
