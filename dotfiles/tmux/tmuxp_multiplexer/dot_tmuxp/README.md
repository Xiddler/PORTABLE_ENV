# Notes

mydailysessions.yaml is the hand-written yaml config file

5-daily-tabs is the ->% tmux freeze version of the above


The main advantage of a tmux session manager like tmuxp is that if I (accidentally) delete a tab I don't have to 
go to all the rounds to recreate my preferred  5-tab set up. $HOME/.tmuxp/mydailysession.yaml will do that after

->% tmuxp load $HOME/.tmuxp/mydailysession.yaml
