Opened 2022-11-25


# Notes
I have had Obsidian in my sights for a lot longer than the Opened date suggests. (Defensive!)

Open Obsidian and when you want to make a new vault with vim keybindings, copy both the .obsidian/ and .obsidian.vimrc to the vault.
I remove the initial . from the file/folder names to make them visible in my ~/PORTABLE_ENV
